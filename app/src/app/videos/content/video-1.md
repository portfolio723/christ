Our wing breaks. 💔
And we are left standing in the silence that follows. 
We don't even try. We’re almost afraid to look too closely and 
𝐪𝐮𝐢𝐞𝐭𝐥𝐲 𝐚𝐜𝐜𝐞𝐩𝐭: 𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐥𝐢𝐟𝐞 𝐡𝐚𝐬 𝐞𝐧𝐝𝐞𝐝 𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐞.
 
A broken wing is one thing, but a collapsed spirit? 
That is everything. ✨
 
𝗢𝘂𝗿 𝗙𝗮𝘁𝗵𝗲𝗿 👑 sees the breaking. 
He sees the snapped trust, the fallen hope, the places where we’ve come undone. 
And He does not look away. 👁️
 
He restores what we cannot. 
He mends not only the wing —but the weariness behind it.

Why? 🤔
 
𝗕𝗲𝗰𝗮𝘂𝘀𝗲 𝗮 𝗯𝗿𝗼𝗸𝗲𝗻 𝘄𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗰𝗮𝗻 𝗵𝗲𝗮𝗹 𝗶𝗻 𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗲 
𝗕𝘂𝘁 𝗮 𝗰𝗼𝗹𝗹𝗮𝗽𝘀𝗲𝗱 𝘀𝗽𝗶𝗿𝗶𝘁 𝗰𝗮𝗻𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗳𝗹𝘆, 𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗻 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗳𝗲𝗰𝘁 𝗳𝗲𝗮𝘁𝗵𝗲𝗿𝘀.🪶
 
So he starts within. 🌱
 
That is why He mends our inward fractures first.
He comes close to the heart that has forgotten its own song 🎶And He reminds us: 
You will rise again. ☀️
 
Then, from the very fractures where you fell apart, 
He gives you a new sky... 🌌
a horizon your former flight could never reach. 
He fills you with a courage you never knew, and a strength that lifts you higher than you ever dreamed. 🦅
 
We all know what it is to be broken. We convince ourselves that shattered wings can never be restored—that our story has reached its end. 
 
But 𝐆𝐎𝐃... 🙌
He is already writing a different story. 📖
He knows how to reconstruct 🏘 
What has been beyond repair. 
 
It begins the moment you dare to place the pieces in His hands. 🤍
