            <p><strong>Yes Beloved 💙</strong></p>
            <br />
            <p>When we wait for a miracle in our lives, when we wait on 𝗝𝗘𝗦𝗨𝗦 and seek Him with all our hearts, we strive to draw near. And after all our trying, He faithfully comes to us.</p>
            <br />
            <p>But then what does 𝗝𝗘𝗦𝗨𝗦 do?</p>
            <br />
            <p>He watches. He searches our hearts. He lifts us up high, only to allow us to fall. Does that surprise you?😇</p>
            <br />
            <p>Yes, my dear, He will break us. He will crush us.🙂 𝗢𝗵, 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗽𝗮𝗶𝗻 𝗶𝘀 𝗱𝗲𝗲𝗽! It can feel ruthless because we have never walked this path before. We feel wounded because we are so comfortable in our own zones, and this pain stirs anger toward Him. &quot;𝗬𝗼𝘂 𝘀𝗮𝗶𝗱 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗹𝗼𝘃𝗲 𝗺𝗲! 𝗛𝗼𝘄 𝗰𝗼𝘂𝗹𝗱 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝘀 𝗯𝗲? 𝗛𝗼𝘄 𝗰𝗼𝘂𝗹𝗱 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗱𝗼 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝘀?&quot; 𝗔 𝗺𝗶𝗹𝗹𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗾𝘂𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗱𝗼𝘂𝗯𝘁𝘀 𝘀𝘄𝗶𝗿𝗹 𝗶𝗻 𝗮 𝘀𝘁𝗼𝗿𝗺 𝗼𝗳 𝗮𝗻𝗴𝗲𝗿 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝗳𝘂𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻..🫠</p>
            <br />
            <p>But see, beloved 💙 Remember this: 𝐇𝐞 𝐢𝐬 𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐅𝐚𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐫 𝐟𝐢𝐫𝐬𝐭,💖 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐧 𝐇𝐞 𝐢𝐬 𝐆𝐨𝐝. I have seen parents who pamper their children too much, and that very indulgence can become a poison. Our 𝐡𝐞𝐚𝐯𝐞𝐧𝐥𝐲 𝐃𝐚𝐝 will never ruin us with such empty pampering👈👈. Yes, my dear, you understand me.</p>
            <br />
            <p>So, do not think evil of Him. Do not shout at Him in rage. Do not shrink from Him in fear. Also, don&apos;t run away from him. He does nothing without a holy and perfect purpose. Never, ever forget that!👈👈</p>
            <br />
            <p>He will break us. This is sure. Why?</p>
            <br />
            <p>𝐁𝐞𝐜𝐚𝐮𝐬𝐞 𝐇𝐞 𝐥𝐨𝐯𝐞𝐬 𝐲𝐨𝐮🫶. Do you seriously know that? Do you understand the depth of that truth?</p>
            <br />
            <p>What he is breaking in us is our carnal nature. our carnal mindset, our carnal habits, our carnal tastes, our carnal morals, and our carnal comforts and perspectives. 𝐇𝐞 𝐢𝐬 𝐬𝐡𝐚𝐭𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐨𝐥𝐝 𝐭𝐨 𝐦𝐚𝐤𝐞 𝐮𝐬 𝐧𝐞𝐰 𝐭𝐨 𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐧𝐬𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐦 𝐮𝐬 𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐨 𝐬𝐩𝐢𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐮𝐚𝐥 𝐛𝐞𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐬 who can contain 𝐇𝐢𝐬 𝐒𝐩𝐢𝐫𝐢𝐭. He breaks us only because He alone knows how to build us into who we were truly meant to be. He does nothing for idle pastime. Please remember that. A carnal being cannot perceive the beauty of spiritual things.😊</p>
            <br />
            <p>He is molding us for Himself—specifically for His glory and our ultimate good.  Behind this fierce process, there is only one reason, 𝐨𝐧𝐞 𝐦𝐚𝐠𝐧𝐢𝐟𝐢𝐜𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐜𝐞: 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐩𝐮𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐲 𝐨𝐟 𝐇𝐈𝐒 𝐋𝐎𝐕𝐄 👑✨.</p>
            <br />
            <p>That is why He will break us, remake us, mold us, and shape us into His own image and according to His perfect will. Then, He will bless us to become a carrier of His radical love to many in His name.</p>
            <br />
            <p>So while He is breaking, remaking, and shaping us, He may seem silent. Oh, that silence feels like hell! At that time, don&apos;t leave that situation in the middle, try to stand with him and hold his hand tightly. He is preparing us in that empty, dry desert of brokenness. But if you rely and wait upon Him in that season, 𝐇𝐞 𝐰𝐢𝐥𝐥 𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐠𝐞 𝐲𝐨𝐮 𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐨 𝐇𝐢𝐬 𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐲 𝐡𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐭 𝐨𝐟 𝐥𝐨𝐯𝐞 💕  for the millions who do not know how to love and are desperate to be loved.𝐇𝐞 𝐰𝐢𝐥𝐥 𝐦𝐚𝐤𝐞 𝐲𝐨𝐮 𝐭𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐲 𝐋𝐨𝐯𝐞 🥰</p>
            <br />
            <p>Always remember this: If 𝐇𝐞 𝐝𝐨𝐞𝐬 𝐧𝐨𝐭 𝐛𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐤 𝐮𝐬, 𝐰𝐞 𝐰𝐢𝐥𝐥 𝐧𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐫 𝐥𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐧 𝐭𝐨 𝐥𝐨𝐯𝐞 𝐥𝐢𝐤𝐞 𝐇𝐢𝐦🙌. In that breaking, He is producing His masterpieces. His love-makers and grace-donors. Without the breaking, there can be no beautiful, lasting building 💒.</p>
            <br />
            <p>Armed 🛡️ with the love He gives you, you will comfort those who are longing for it. 𝗕𝗲𝗰𝗮𝘂𝘀𝗲 𝗝𝗘𝗦𝗨𝗦 𝗶𝘀 𝗹𝗼𝘃𝗲 𝗶𝘁𝘀𝗲𝗹𝗳!⚡</p>
            <br />
            <p>And one more thing,  if He does not break you, it is not a sign of His love. But when He breaks you, He invests His entire focus on you. He cannot and will not leave you for a minute, not even a single second. 𝗬𝗼𝘂 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘀𝗼𝗹𝗲 𝗼𝗯𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁 𝗼𝗳 𝗛𝗶𝘀 𝗿𝗲𝗳𝗶𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻. How honoured we are!🙌</p>
            <br />
            <p>So do not fear, beloved 💙</p>
            <p>You are held securely in the 𝐥𝐢𝐯𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐅𝐚𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐫&apos;s 𝐡𝐚𝐧𝐝𝐬 🤲🫶 And listen closely, dear one: 𝗛𝗲 𝘄𝗶𝗹𝗹 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗱 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗮𝗻𝘆𝘄𝗵𝗲𝗿𝗲 𝘁𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗛𝗶𝘀 𝗴𝗿𝗮𝗰𝗲 𝗵𝗮𝘀 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗮𝗹𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗱𝘆 𝗴𝗼𝗻𝗲 𝗯𝗲𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂 🌸</p>
            <br />
            <p>𝐇𝐚𝐥𝐥𝐞𝐥𝐮𝐣𝐚𝐡 indeed 🙌</p>
