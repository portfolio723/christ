              <p>My dear, Let me tell you something your soul needs to remember.</p>
              <p>What is the love of God?</p>
              <p>What would he have done?</p>
              <p>Listen...</p>
              <p>You were His first thought.</p>
              <p>Before oceans,before mountains, before light, He saw you.</p>
              <p>And He loved you.</p>
              <p>You were the joy set before Him, the treasure He longed for.</p>
              <p>do you know what he did?</p>
              <p>The Father, He gave His most precious Son‚Äîfor you.</p>
              <p>because His heart could not bear eternity without you.</p>
              <p>It was the ultimate act of a Father&apos;s heart crying out, &quot;I must have my child back.&quot;</p>
              <p>Then Jesus...oh, Jesus&apos; love</p>
              <p>He saw you across time and chose the cross.</p>
              <p>He willingly embraced the cross... not just for the world, but for you. is a mighty, roaring flood that could not be contained by heaven&apos;s gates. It shattered the grave. It broke hell&apos;s chains. He didn&apos;t just die for you.He devoured death for you.</p>
              <p>His heart thundered:</p>
              <p>I will have my child. I will fight for my child. I will give everything to my child.</p>
              <p>And now the Holy Spirit...</p>
              <p>The Spirit&apos;s love is so intimate, so tender, that He doesn&apos;t just walk beside you. He has made your heart His Home. He breathes inside your prayers. He sings over you in the night. He is the quiet, unshakable presence that whispers, &quot;You are never, ever alone.&quot;</p>
              <p>People say love is God.</p>
              <p>No.</p>
              <p>&quot;God is love&quot;.It is his nature.</p>
              <p>Every heartbeat of heaven beats for you.</p>
              <p>And sometimes...sometimes, in the quiet moments when I feel the weight of this love‚Ä¶ that love wraps around my broken places...It burns with one eternal question, the only one I&apos;ll need to ask when I finally see Him face to face:</p>
              <p>how unworthy I am...</p>
              <p>&quot;Jesus... why? Why did You love me with a love this fierce? This relent? This mighty?&quot;</p>
              <p>I may never understand it fully.</p>
              <p>But I will spend my life embraced by it.</p>
              <p>And so will you.</p>
              <p>And you...you are His.</p>
