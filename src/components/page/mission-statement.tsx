            <p>Oh, my sweet doe, you are so precious to Me 💖</p>
            <p>I love you, and My hand is upon you.</p>
            <p>I will lay you down in green pastures</p>
            <p>and raise you up as a woman for the nations.</p>
            <p>You came here to rest under My wings—</p>
            <p>the wings of Jehovah 💗</p>
            <p>I will never disappoint you,</p>
            <p>My graceful deer.</p>
            <p>You are more important to Me than you realize…</p>
            <p>More than you want Me—</p>
            <p>I wanted you more than you have ever imagined 💞</p>
            <p>Yes, My woman, I love you</p>
            <p>simply because I love you.</p>
            <p>My love will never wound you.</p>
            <p>My touch will never bring you pain.</p>
            <p>I love you for who you are,</p>
            <p>expecting nothing in return—unlike the world.</p>
            <p>Choose My love, and live for Me.</p>
            <p>I will do more than you can possibly imagine 💫</p>
            <p>I want you closer than you dare to believe.</p>
            <p>I AM your God. Always.</p>
            <p>I have no regrets in choosing you.</p>
            <p>Yes. None.</p>
            <p>That is enough for now, Princess…</p>
            <p>I must close this scroll of My heart here!!!</p>
            <p>Otherwise, the world will hear</p>
            <p>all the secrets it holds about you… 😉💕</p>
